1. Provide the following information:

  1. Enter the name of your project in the **Project name** field. You can't use
     special characters, but you can use spaces, hyphens, underscores or even
     emoji.
  1. If you have a project in a different repository, you can import it by 
     clicking an **Import project from** button and following the instructions
     at [Migrating projects to a GitLab instance](../workflow/importing/README.md).
  1. The **Project description (optional)** field enables you to enter a 
     description for your project's dashboard, which will help others
     understand what your project is about. Though it's not required, it's a good
     idea to fill this in.
  1. Changing the **Visibility Level** modifies the project's
     [viewing and access rights](../public_access/public_access.md) for users. 

1. Click **Create project**.
